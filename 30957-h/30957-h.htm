<p>The use of the term <span class="u">preparation</span> herein is intended to indicate
partially the limitation of the problem attempted. The following
discussion will be concerned only with such attributes of the
successful teacher as are the direct result, or at least greatly
enhanced by thorough preparation. A sufficiently comprehensive and
difficult problem remains after still further restriction of the field
so as to include only subject matter and the method of biological
science.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to make the statement that the standards of
preparation and the facilities for meeting these standards have been
enormously improved within the past few years. Evidence of this is
found in the changes recently made in the curricula of and the
requirements for graduation from the California State Teachers
Colleges. Neither is it necessary to say that improvement must
continue. Such problems are evolutionary. Notwithstanding that
requirements for teachers certificates have been raised the country
over, the universities are not generally making very rapid strides in
affording opportunities for better preparation in subject-matter and
special methods. In corroboration, witness the recent criticisms of
the departmental courses in special methods now given in universities
generally (Swift, 1918; Taylor, 1918). The length of time or the
number of units of work required for certification may be increased
but that does not insure a finer <span class="u">quality</span> of preparation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
In attempting to explain the slow pace of improvement in the
quality of preparation for the teaching of science, one becomes
involved in a cycle. Science had its development in the college
and university whence it diffused slowly into the secondary schools,
and finally slightly into the elementary grades. The differences
between the aims of college science and secondary school science
were and still are not taken sufficiently into account. As an
inevitable result there are to be found in the curricula of high
schools too many science courses that are mere dilutions of the college
type, with no modification of purpose, and just enough change in
method and subject matter to bring them partially within the
power of understanding of the less mature mind. This situation
in turn reflected upon the higher institutions of learning in such
a way that it seemed that they were giving adequate training of
the correct type. And such would have been the case had the
college course in the particular science been planned for the
express purpose of being diluted to suit secondary school needs.
But it will be generally conceded that such courses never have
existed.</p>

<p>Another retarding factor in the evolution of the problem has been the
subordination of special training in subject matter to other really less
important qualifications, in the selection of teachers. The table given
below, compiled from statistics gathered in one of the States during 1916,
shows sufficient justification for the above statement. And not only has the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
preparation in subject matter been too little considered in choosing
teachers, but also in the administration of schools specially intended
for teacher-training. An educator of high standing in California is
credited with making the criticism of the Normal Schools of the State;
that they attempt to teach a person how to teach intelligently
something about which he knows nothing. When teachers have adequate
preparation in subject matter as well as in methods, and when they are
employed to teach only those subjects for which they are fitted, then
the problem of maintaining a high standard of teaching will be well
nigh solved.</p>

<h2>Preparation in Subject Matter</h2>


<p>Before facing the problem of preparation for the teaching of
biological sciences in the secondary schools, there must be a
clear conception of the aims and legitimate purposes of these
sciences in the high school. We are fortunate in having the aims
of biology clearly and concisely stated by the Commission on the
Reorganization of Secondary Education of the N.E.A. ("Reorganization
of Science in Secondary Schools", U.S. Dep't. Interior, Bureau of
Education, Bulletin 26, 1920). These aims will not be considered
in their entirety but only in so far as they bear directly on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
problems that follow. Before proceeding further, for simplification
we will assume that the teacher is assigned to teach biological
sciences only. Even then the field is quite comprehensive, for
besides instruction in general biology, there will be courses of
a more advanced type, in Zoology, Botany, Physiology, and often
Bacteriology, Sanitation, or Agriculture. However, with preparation
in the fundamentals necessary for biology a teacher should be
able to conduct such courses without difficulty. Thus the problem
is sufficiently inclusive if it concerns preparation for biology
alone.</p>

<p>The brief literal translation of the word <span class="u">biology</span>, science of
life, is full explanation of its scope. A course in the subject
is not Zoology, nor Botany, nor Bacteriology, nor Physiology&mdash;but
rather all of these in one. Biology should logically follow the
nature study of the elementary grades. The course must be so
planned that it will give the pupils the maximum of serviceable
fundamentals and at the same time be a basis for further study in
advanced courses, if he desires to continue; but such that he will
miss none of the essentials if he does not. Since science is
the product of mature minds, the culmination of knowledge, then in
this course for adolescents, the "ology" must not be too greatly
stressed lest the essential part, the "bios" be obscured. The
goal then is a course in which a study of plant life, a study of
bacteria in relation to human welfare, a study of animal life,
and the biology of the human, are all incorporated with well
balanced emphasis.  This is the type of course recommended by
the Commission on Reorganization for the ninth or tenth year
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
pupils, so is the end toward which preparation should be made.</p>

<p>The next question concerns what constitutes adequate preparation
for the direction of studies of animate nature. First and foremost
is a realization of the aims, or better, the values, and relations
of biology. It is a socializing subject and must be so taught&mdash;man
is social. Biology affects man vitally, directly his behavior
follows natural laws, and indirectly by illustration and comparison
brings him to a better understanding biologic laws underlying the
organization of society. By way of illustration we need only to
cite the struggle for existence and the division of labor with
their far reaching influence in determining the course of evolution.
It would be impossible, I believe, to teach biology so poorly that
it did not have some socializing value; but it comes very near
to being done in some cases, there is little doubt.</p>

<p>A paramount aim is the improvement of living conditions, both
as it concerns measures for group sanitation and factors in the
health of the individual. This should be the almost exclusive aim
in those parts of the course dealing with bacteria and disease,
and the biology of man, or physiology and eugenics. Biology has
many applications in our economic life. It is the very foundation
of agriculture. The lumber industry is beginning to find that
there are biologic laws. The Government of the United States some
time ago established a Bureau of Fisheries for the purpose of
studying the biological problems involved in the continuance and
furtherance of our extensive fisheries industry.</p>

<p>So far as the individual is concerned, biology should train him to
observe life phenomena accurately and to form logical conclusions,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
through the use of problems. This ability is a valuable asset whatever
his life work may be. Also, if it is the right kind of a course, and
well taught, it will enrich the life of the boy or girl through the
aesthetic appeal of plants and animals, and so make possible a sincere
appreciation and enjoyment of nature. In addition, the study of
biology should make clear to the pupil the important part that the
intensive study of the various biological sciences has played in the
whole marvelous scientific progress of the past centuries.</p>

<p>Along with these values certain relations of biology must be
well understood if it is to be well taught. These relations may
be conveniently segregated into five groups, 1) relations to
world problems, 2) to problems of the state, 3) to the community,
4) to the school curriculum, and 5) to individual pupils. To
world problems biology bears many relations, for example, it is
fundamental in the analysis of immigration problems, especially
those phases concerning health, over-population, and the probable
hereditary effects of assimilation through hybridization. State
problems of health protection, conservation of game and forests,
control of rodents and other crop pests, and others can only be
solved after gaining a thorough knowledge of the underlying
natural laws, and acting in accordance with them. How inadequate
a game conservation law of closed season, without regard to the
breeding habits of the animal concerned! Again, State regulations
regarding the care of mentally deficient, especially in the prevention
of intermarriage, must be given consideration from the biological
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
as well as the ethical point of view.</p>

<p>As we consider the smaller group unit so the relations of biology to
that group become more special. A biology course may be readily
standardized for national problems, but for any given community the
course must be somewhat unique. A course planned for a rural
population would not be fitted for a school in an overcrowded section
of a city. Where there are differences in social and biological
problems there also must be fitting adaptive changes in the course in
biology. In addition to these community relations, the teacher must
keep in mind the relations between the biology course and the other
courses in the curriculum of the school. Such a question as this
should arise in the mind of the teacher; how may my work be made to
correlate with that of Domestic Science? The possibilities are many,
there is the field of dietetics, scientific determination of the best
methods of sweeping methods by bacterial culture methods, and the role
of bacteria, yeasts and molds in the culinary arts constitute a few of
them. How about cooperation with the English Department? Certainly
every bit of written work, every oral recitation, should measure up to
standards of ability in expression as well as to standards of
attainment in the mastery of certain scientific information. This
cooperation has been carried out to great mutual benefit in some
schools. These illustrations are sufficient to illustrate, though the
teacher should not overlook any department of the school.</p>

<p>Relations to class and to individual will be considered in conjunction
with teaching methods.</p>

<p>The values and interrelations of biology have been discussed at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
some length because they must serve as criteria in deciding what
constitutes adequate preparation.</p>

<p>The comprehensiveness and vital nature of the subject, biology,
present at once an inspiration and an element of fear to the
conscientious teacher. They cause him to regard in utter amazement,
the applicant for a position who in answer to question replies "No, I
have never taken any courses in biological Science, but I can easily
prepare myself to teach it, if need be." The impossibility of such
impromptu development of skill in the teaching of biology will become
more apparent as we proceed.</p>

<p>Besides a full appreciation of the aims and relations of the subject,
the teacher must be able to construct a course especially adapted in
content to the peculiar needs of the particular community. This
follows from what was said of relations in a previous paragraph. The
development of such a course demands sufficient knowledge of economics
and sociology to make possible a correct analysis of local conditions
and so find what is required. The course to fulfill the requirements
will necessarily be to some extent new, and just to such extent may
the teacher feel something of the inspiration of the pioneer. Relative
values must be established; emphasis must be properly placed&mdash;life of
distant regions should not be taught except as local material may not
be available to illustrate some very essential point, yet too often a
carefully pickled grasshopper is transported from Florida to
California, there to be dissected by some unfortunate high school lad.
Not only must the larger divisions of the course be carefully balanced
and tested for value, but each lesson must justify its induction into
it. It is at this point that the relation to the individual is the
chief criterion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Each lesson of the series that makes up the course must
justify its place by having some rather direct bearing upon the
life of the individual pupil.  The core of the lesson must be
either the pupils problem or one in which his interest can be
readily stimulated.  Herein is the value of the project method
of science teaching, the problem is sure to be of interest to the
pupil since he himself chooses it.  Other questions to which
the lesson must give satisfactory answer are; Why this particular
lesson, at all?  What relation does it bear to the preceding and
following lessons?  Is it of real value to the pupil in his living?
What biological phenomenon does it teach?  Is it the best problem
to illustrate that particular phenomenon?  What generalizations
and practical applications can the <span class="u">pupil</span> make?</p>

<p>The organization of a course in biology which is fitted to
the needs of a certain community, the conditions of a particular
class of pupils, and to the needs of the individual pupils so far
as possible, requires that the teacher have an extensive knowledge
of the subject matter as a background freeing him from the necessity
of dependence on a textbook.  Anyway, a biology teacher conducting
the right sort of a course, will see that the textbook is only
an incidental, if used at all.  A continuation of set assignments
in most textbooks would dampen the ardor of pupils generally.
Besides, few localities have textbooks fitted to their specific
needs.  One that does have is New York City.  In fact it has two,
"Elementary Biology" by Peabody &amp; Hunt, and "Civic Biology" by Hunter.
These both have a large sale throughout the United States.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
But, of course, in most localities they can be used only to furnish
supplementary reading, since <span class="u">portions</span> only will be adapted to the
conditions of the restricted locality. The fundamental life processes
are the same the world over, but varying environmental conditions
necessitates a variation in emphasis, in application, and in the
choice of problems which make up the course. If the teacher is well
prepared in subject matter, there is little use for a laboratory
manual except as it may suggest new methods and new experimental
materials. Students of the high school age should never be compelled
to follow a set laboratory outline with detailed instructions for
procedure; it will kill every whit of initiative. The teacher must be
so prepared, then, that he is able to steer a free course, employing
books for reference and supplementary reading almost exclusively. He
will cause the student to realize that the books are the result of
<span class="u">human</span> effort and therefor not infallible, and that they must always
take second place to first hand observation and experiment. The study
of animate nature, with endless opportunity for observation and
experiment on every hand, permits little excuse for such method as is
illustrated by "Be prepared to recite on the next three pages in the
book, tomorrow, and read experiment 37 so that you wont have to waste
any time in getting started with the laboratory work".</p>

<p>Somewhere in the course of preparation the teacher must have
obtained a thorough knowledge of laboratory apparatus and supplies.
The selection of types of apparatus best fitted to the course, and
the knowledge of where to buy are both necessary.  Also judgement
must be exercised in purchase for few are the places where funds are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
adequate for the ideal equipment of a laboratory.  The money value
of every piece of apparatus must be balanced against its relative
usefulness in the successful culmination of the course.  Besides
this there must be a knowledge of the various uses to which the available
apparatus may be put.  A great deal depends on the ingenuity of
the teacher in the adaptation of even comparatively simple apparatus.
In connection with the laboratory part (and this should be the major
part) of the course, there arises the question of field work and
excursions.  Laboratory is at best merely a substitute for the
great out-of-doors, so the more work that can be done in the field
the better.  Aside from exploration to discover what parts of the
particular locality will yield the largest fund of valuable biological
information, the problem here is mainly one of method.</p>

<p>The teacher to be at his best must be somewhat of a naturalist.
Upon his fund of interesting stories about the animals and plants
that the children all know, will depend very largely the appeal of
the work to the pupil.  Something of the spirit that distinguished
John Muir as the great naturalist is an inestimable asset to the
teacher.  If it is not among his natal blessings, he need not
be completely discouraged for it can be acquired to some degree at
least.  Besides the advantage just mentioned, the fauna and flora
must be sufficiently well known so that <span class="u">choice</span> is possible for
laboratory experiment and illustrative purposes.</p>

<p>In order to present any subject well, its historical aspect
enters into consideration.  The influence of individuals, of
governments, of religion, and of the social ideals have all had
their share in determining the present status of the subject.
Science as it now is, is the result of growth, it has undergone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
evolution, and is at present evolving.  This will be thoroughly
understood by the teacher of science, and this understanding will
determine in part the method of presentation.  In the history of
the development of science there are many men well worthy of hero
worship.  It is hard to find more inspirational characters than
those of Pasteur, and Lazear; men who devoted (in latter instance,
sacrificed life) their lives to service for humanity.  In the
life and work of Charles Darwin we find a splendid example of
painstaking search for the truth.  The records of the rocks,
(Paleontology, the nature-written history of biology) will often
come to the rescue of the teacher in clearing up the presentation
of the difficult problems of evolution.  The historic attitude
must be "put over" to the pupil too, for <span class="u">he</span> must know his world
as the result of the evolutionary process, and as still in the
process of evolution.</p>

<p>Even at the risk of adverse criticism I desire to include
among the qualifications of a good teacher the spirit of research.
This spirit can be acquired by specialization in one of the fields
of biological science, followed by some actual research work.</p>

<p>Research in science is fundamental. It has three aims or
ends, 1) discovery of facts thus increasing the sum total of
knowledge.  This is science for science sake.  2) Individual
development.  And, 3) Social service. These last two aims are
most important to the teacher.  So, his problem for investigation
should have some practical bearing, and should be of his own
choosing, not pointedly suggested by the professor in charge as is
too often the case.  If the research student is given a problem
which is some minor part of a larger problem being investigated by
his professor it will preclude the very thing the prospective teacher
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
needs, namely practice in recognizing, analyzing, and solving a
problem in its entirety and solely on his own resources.  Being
a mere helper is probably not the best way to secure such ability.
Investigation may be broadening and developing to the individual
or it may prove to be quite the reverse, but that lies within the
control of the individual.  Research for the teacher must emphasize
equally actual additions to knowledge and personal attitude.  It
must not be an end in itself but a means to an end.  The attitude
of the investigator is essential to the understanding of children
for the child is first of all an investigator.  His questions,
"what? why? how? when?" prove this beyond doubt.  What is this but
a search for truth, causal factors, and interrelations?  Education
uses this wholesome curiosity as a foundation principle, so the
teacher must exhibit a sympathetic understanding of this universal
attribute of children.  No better summary of a discussion of the
values of research can be found for our purposes than that by
G. W. A. Luckey.  It follows.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In order that teaching may be intelligent and in harmony
with the laws of nature there must be a deeper and clearer
knowledge of human growth and development.  The teacher must
know the nature of the individual to be taught and the ends to
be reached in proper nurture.  This can not be gained through
the study of books alone, but may come through properly directed
research in the workshop of life."</p>

<p>One of the aims of present day education is "to develop a man, the
best man possible under the conditions; to assist nature through
nurture; to enable the individual to find himself and to evolve
naturally and rapidly to the highest levels and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
even to rise above them. According to this conception ... the
initiative must come from within. The aim of the teacher should be to
develop a self-sustaining, self-directing, altruistic individual
keenly alive to the interests of humanity. Such an ideal is
progressive, scientific, and fits one through studies of yesterday and
today to live the best and truest life tomorrow. To see and appreciate
this ideal, research is necessary."</p></div>

<p>The last requirement to be considered in this discussion, is a good
foundation in Physics and Chemistry. Biological science is not
entirely separable from physical science, for a majority of life
phenomena, in final analysis can be explained only in terms of
physical science. Physiology has for its very foundation Physics and
Chemistry. Among the newest of the sciences is Biochemistry, the
chemistry of life; and within its limits are some of the most
promising fields of research. No argument is necessary, a knowledge of
physical science is indispensable in the interpretation of life
phenomena, and the understanding of biological processes.</p>

<h2>PREPARATION in METHODS</h2>


<p>Method is more closely associated with personality and with native
ability than is subject matter. So much more must preparation in this
field be general in nature. It must mainly concern the general
principles of the scientific method. Specific problems and minor
details will have to be worked out in actual practice. The final
method found most satisfactory by any teacher, will be to some extent
unique, but will be largely determined by three factors; the aptitudes
of the teacher, himself, the group that he is teaching,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and lastly, the consideration of the individual pupil. Ability to adapt
ones procedure so as to most nearly meet these requirements, will come
about only through experience. Ability to profit by experience, the
human attribute which makes possible the progress of civilization, is
a no less valuable asset to a teacher than to any other member of
society.</p>

<p>Balliet points out that science teaching has passed through
three stages in the past generation.  The first stage is characterized
by the textbook method, occasionally supplemented by illustrative
experiment, performed by the teacher.  The second stage is
characterized by individual laboratory experiment, a manual for a
guide, and by a lack of application of the principles except for a
few traditional cases.  The third stage improves upon the second
by leading the pupil, after formulating his generalizations, to
apply them to the facts and phenomena of nature.  "But", continues
Balliet, "we must advance to a fourth stage.  We must not only
apply the generalizations, but make the <span class="u">explanation</span> of the facts
and phenomena of nature&mdash;the interpretation of nature&mdash;the very
goal of science teaching."  All problems should be chosen then in
the light of this last aim. The problems must be natural, not in
any way artificial, and they should be those of the immediate
environment of the pupil.  To meet these obligations may be in
some cases difficult, but it should not be impossible.</p>

<p>In biological science there is a rich field permitting a
considerable choice in method.  There are observations, projects,
experiments, excursions, individual reports, book readings, quizzes,
and conferences.  In a single well chosen problem or project
nearly all of these will be employed.  Biology lends itself ideally
to the problem method of teaching.  By using some every day problem
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of the pupil, his interest is assured.  Even a seemingly simple
problem if skilfully directed, will ramify into several fields of
biology before its solution is completed.  And the number of
practicable problems is almost limitless, but not all are equally
good for the purpose, so the teacher must often tactfully modify
the pupils choice.  Original choices are likely to be too complex
for the pupil to solve at his stage of progress, so must be
simplified, without his feeling that he has been interfered with,
without causing a wane in his interest.  It is clear that the real
problem in the problem-method is the teacher's.  Practically, it
is quite impossible to handle <span class="u">individual</span> projects in large classes.
In the writer's experience, he has had on the average 80 different
pupils per day in four separate classes.  It is clearly beyond the
power of any teacher to direct simultaneously eighty different
projects, and it would be a physical impossibility to furnish the
necessary laboratory apparatus.  So, for this reason the teacher
may find it necessary to divide, as diplomatically as possible,
the classes into congenial groups, each with its problem, so that
the total number of problems will be so limited that each one may
be given adequate attention.  It seems that such must be the limitation
of the problem-method under the conditions prevailing in the
public schools today.</p>

<p>The procedure in solving a problem will consist of these steps
in the order named, 1) understanding of the purpose, 2) the procedure
or method of attack, 3) observation of results, 4) and the
use of these in making some generalizations or arriving at some
conclusions.  Then there must follow a testing of these generalizations
or conclusions by further experimentation.  Accuracy must
be the keynote of all work, accuracy in recording experiments,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
accuracy in observation, accuracy in drawing, which serves as a
shortcut method of description.  Neatness is very desireable but
should never supercede thinking and understanding.  If the problem
has stimulated some accurate logical thinking on the part of the
pupil, then time spent on it has been well spent.  If, besides, it
has yielded some valuable useable information, the solving of the
problem has been a marked success.  The laboratory method has been
such an emancipation from the textbook slavery that there is some
tendency to elevate it to an end in itself, whereas it must serve
only as a very valuable <span class="u">means</span> to an end.  "The ideal laboratory
is only a reasonably good substitute for the out-of-doors."</p>

<p>So far as preparation in the methods of science teaching is
concerned, much good may be accomplished in teachers courses and
in practice teaching.  But it must necessarily be of a general
nature, for the unique individual method, determined by the interaction
of teacher and pupil and the reaction of both to subject
matter can evolve only hand in hand with teaching experience.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further it might be well, by way of summary, to
remind ourselves that the minimum qualifications for a teacher of
biology must include the following; a) a large fund of the most
interesting and most valuable facts of biology, b) a full realization
of the values and vital relations of biology to humanity, c) ability
to develop a course meeting the unique needs of the community,
d) familiarity with purchase and useability of laboratory equipment,
e) knowledge of the history of science, f) spirit of and sympathy with
research, g) a knowledge of physical science as related to biology,
h) and knowledge of the laboratory method and its value in the
promotion of accurate logical constructive thinking.</p>

<h2>OPPORTUNITY FOR ADEQUATE PREPARATION.</h2>


<p>What possibilities of making adequate preparation, are to be
found in colleges and universities?  And how much preparation is
required by the Teacher's Recommendation or other standards of
fitness?  In search of the answers to our questions, we may study
conditions at the University of California, for there is as good
opportunity and standards are as high in this school as anywhere
in the country.  The quantity of preparation is fairly assured by
the five-year requirement for the Teacher's Recommendation, but the
quality of the preparation is not so certainly assured.  With the
possible exception of the Education Department, no department considers
the training of teachers even nearly equal in importance to
the production of specialists in the subject who shall devote their
lives to research.  The subject is regarded as an end in itself.</p>

<p>If a person were directed to make preparation for the teaching
of biology, he would be at a loss in searching for the Biology
Department, or even a department that gave a good comprehensive
course in biology.  The subject as best taught in the secondary
schools is subdivided into various components, each with its special
aim.  The prospective teacher has no carefully prepared course of
study for his pursuit, as has the prospective doctor, engineer, or
farmer.  The state provides a specially adapted course of training
for its veterinarians, those who care for its livestock.  Why not
a special course of high standard for those who plan to devote their
lives to the direction of the formative years of its children? It
is probably explained in large part by the failure to recognize
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
teaching as a profession. The Schools of Education throughout the
country have been insisting upon real professional training for
teachers but other departments are deplorably slow in cooperating.</p>

<p>In order to avoid becoming entangled in abstractions, we may
choose a specific instance to show the difficulties in the way of
securing the correct <span class="u">kind</span> of preparation, even though the quantity
is guaranteed. The Zoology Department (I choose this department
neither because it is worse nor better than any other, but because
I am better acquainted with the content of its courses) makes the
following requirements for the Teacher's Recommendation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>General Zoology</p>

<p>Invertebrate Zoology&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>an advanced course which omits all consideration of insects,
and all discussion of parasitic forms.</p></div>

<p>Vertebrate Zoology&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>mainly a course in comparative morphology,
which gives no field knowledge of California vertebrates, the most
essential thing for the high school teacher.</p></div>

<p>and one subject from each of the following groups,</p>

<p>Group I<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Comparative Anatomy.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cytology&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>basic principles must be understood by the teacher but he
should not have to spend one whole half year to acquire them.</p></div>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Embryology.&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>the above is also true for this course.</p></div>

<p>Group II.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Biology of Water Supplies&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>this course is primarily for sanitary engineers.</p></div>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Protozoology&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>All that is necessary of this could be incorporated
in a general course.</p></div>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Parasitology&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>essential for health instruction and for
illustration of certain biological principles.</p></div>

<p>Group III.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Experimental Zoology &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } combination of these valuable.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Animal Behavior &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heredity, Evolution, and Eugenics&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>this course is very essential for <span class="u">any</span> teacher.</p></div>
<p>(Required in the fifth year, the Teachers' Course, some work in research, and practice teaching.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Taken as a whole, the chief criticism to be made is that the subject has
been so subdivided to insure no overlapping of courses, that it
becomes necessary to take every course in order to obtain a well
rounded preparation in the field.  This requires more time than
any individual can devote to it, for he must also have preparation
in Botany, Physiology, and Bacteriology and Hygiene, and in these
departments the arrangement of courses is essentially the same.
The general course in Zoology is inadequate, for it is planned for
an introduction to the more advanced courses and is careful not to
steal too much from their fund of interesting information.  The
aim is to lay a thorough foundation rather than to discuss the
more interesting facts and general principles of biology, though I
am glad to believe that the present trend is decidedly in this
latter direction.</p>

<p>Here we find adequate preparation for a teacher of <span class="u">Zoology</span>,
but in no secondary school of the state will a teacher be employed
for Zoology alone.  In high schools the biological science curriculum
the first course must be <span class="u">Biology</span>, and it must be all-inclusive,
for it is all of the biological science that the majority of the
pupils will take.  It would be a great step in advance if every
school <span class="u">required</span> even that much for graduation.</p>

<p>Of the courses in Invertebrate Zoology and Vertebrate Zoology, it can
be safely said that they overlook the importance of field work. Boys
and girls sometimes have a surprisingly large superficial knowledge of
the plants and animals of their vicinity, and this knowledge is of the
sort obtained through observation of their ways in nature, that is, it
is a <span class="u">field</span> knowledge. The teacher must be prepared to use this to
the greatest possible extent, but how can this be expected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
if the teacher knows little if any more than the children about the habits
of plants and animals. Such training would have to be obtained through
some of the field work of the Museum of Vertebrate zoology. But no
work in that department is required for the Teachers Recommendation. A
knowledge, though not an intensive knowledge, of each of the subjects
that make up the three groups included in the requirements is quite
necessary but it is out of the question for a person to take them all
unless he specialize in Zoology. Not all can be expected to major in
Zoology, and those that do will find it necessary to omit much that is
essential in the other departments of biological science. Each
department should have a general course covering fully its field of
work so that those majoring in some other department may in minimum
time gain a fair knowledge of its field. It is very doubtful if such a
course is given in any department at present.</p>

<p>At present only a meagre view is had of the history of Biology,
until the fifth year when it is given as seminar work.  And at no
time, in any course, are the aims and relations of biology presented
in such a way as to be helpful to one attempting to plan the most
valuable type of high school course.  Graduate research has been
sufficiently considered previously, and the teachers' course will
be considered last.</p>

<p>It will be conceded generally in thinking of the solution of the
problem that the ideal arrangement would be a real teachers' course,
at least five years in length. This could be comparatively easily
accomplished by a slight modification of the departments concerned and
their hearty cooperation with the Department of Education. The disregard
for method on the part of the former and the failure to realize the
importance of a thorough knowledge of subject matter by the latter, can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
are obstacles that can be easily overcome I am sure.
The student would enter upon this course with the intention of
becoming a teacher, just as does any student enter upon his
professional course with the intention of becoming the professional
man for which his training is preparing him. Few freshmen now come to
the University of California with the intention of becoming teachers
in the secondary schools, that I admit, but the reasons and the remedy
for that are not for discussion here. Suffice it to say that when
reward is adequate, then the profession will grow and come to be made
up of the highest type of men and women.</p>

<p>The time of the Teachers Course is not far distant and it might be
worth while to see what could be done without radical modifications in
the curricula of the departments as they now are. For a working basis
I would like to present the following skeleton programme, which seems
practicable. In this schedule all preparation except that in subject
matter and method is understood to be included in "electives". A major
in Zoology is assumed. Each biological science department would have a
course of similar plan built about its major as a core.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
First year,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Geography or Geology</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Aims of science and its human values.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Chemistry</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Electives</span><br />
<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Zoology,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Physics,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Electives</span><br />
<br />
Third year,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Zoology&mdash;advanced courses</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Botany,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Physiology</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Electives</span><br />
<br />
Fourth year,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Zoology&mdash;advanced courses</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bacteriology, and Public Health</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Electives</span><br />
<br />
Fifth year,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Zoology&mdash;research</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">History of Science</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Teachers' Course, correlated with and supplementary to practice teaching.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Electives</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>The reasons for selection and sequence of subjects in this
schedule are fairly evident from what has gone before, but a few
points will bear additional explanation.</p>

<p>A course in the aims and values of science should be introductory, for
in the absence of general knowledge concerning values, such as has
grown up with other professions, the student must be given early in
his work an enthusiasm for it and a sort of guide for future choice of
subjects for study. The difference in aim between university and
secondary school science must be clearly understood at the start. Too
often, university courses accept science as an end in itself and it is
taught from that point of view, whereas the prospective teacher must
hold to his point of view, that to humanity generally science is only
a very effective means to an end; it is just a faithful servant.</p>

<p>The schedule just submitted may seem to be overbalanced with
science courses, but it must be somewhat so, especially if courses
are not to be completely reorganized.  Science would not need to
consume quite so large a part of the time if special courses were
given for teachers&mdash;another argument for a high grade, strictly
professional course.</p>

<p>Duplication of teachers' courses in special methods would be
eliminated for a single course for all of the departments of biological
science would be sufficient.  Biology is the hub, and not
the separate biological sciences, in the courses in this field in the
secondary schools.  The methods concerned are <span class="u">biological</span> <span class="u">methods</span>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and therefore a single course for all prospective teachers of
biological science regardless of the nature of their major work,
is a logical procedure.  Whether such a course is a success or a
failure is largely dependent on the professor in charge.  In the
past there have been many failures, mainly because the person
conducting it has never had secondary school experience, knows
little or nothing of the problems, and has no sincere enthusiasm
for the teaching of science to boys and girls below the university
age.</p>

<p>The course suggested would cover an entire year.  At least that
much time is required to give any direction or instruction that is
worth while.  The first half of the year might well be devoted to
a digestion and correlation of all previous work, organizing it into
a form easily useable in the work to follow.  Questions of method,
recitation, laboratory and field work, textbooks and reference books
purchase and use of equipment, must be given consideration in some
part of the course.  An outline course, with the separate lessons
that make it up should be worked out in detail, for some particular
locality, preferably the one where practice teaching is to be done.
This should then be carefully tested by the criteria of a good
biology course, as pointed out by the best authorities, and by
<span class="u">common</span> <span class="u">sense</span>.  But why make this skeleton outline beforehand? Why
be prepared in anything? It will be too late to prepare at the
moment the problem has to be met.  Few new teachers will find a
well planned course awaiting their arrival in a new field, and
without previous experience a new teacher is likely to build up a
course without due respect to relative values which comes only with
a perspective of a course in its entirety.  To illustrate, in the
course given by an inexperienced teacher there is too much chance of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
six weeks time being spent on the study of the grasshopper, with
only four weeks left at the end of the school year to be devoted
to the biology of the human.  The mapping of a course, by way of
practice, gives the prospective teacher practice in the exercise of
judgment, with helpful constructive criticism.</p>

<p>Practice teaching now becomes only the trying out of the course and
accompanying methods. As, one practice teacher remarked when this plan
was suggested "But, I might have to make my course all over." Such
would often be the case. Any wide-awake teacher will change his course
more or less from year to year. Even if the first plan were entirely
discarded the energy and thought prompted by its making would not be
lost. And now let us change the name given to those in charge of
practice teachers. Advisor would be more fitting than <span class="u">super</span>visor,
for they should remain in the background except for rendering helpful
service, and making constructive criticism in excess of destructive.</p>

<p>In order for practice teaching to be effective there must be nothing
of an artificial sort enter in. Conditions must be of the regular sort
met every day in the teaching game. This statement seems superfluous,
but a visit to some of the classes where practice teaching is being
done will justify its insertion here. The practice teacher should not
be handed over a laboratory properly equipped. Of course, the
equipment should be available. The course should not be "ready-cut".
The practice teacher must meet <span class="u">all</span> of the problems and this is
cheating him out of a part of his fun. Through his solution of these problems
there will be a two-fold benefit, for the <span class="u">advisor</span> too may profit by
the ingenuity of the newcomer. Resignation should be requested of any advisor
who has outgrown the ability to learn. It is most likely to be the "green"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
person, who will develop really new methods, or evolve a more fitting
experiment, or turn a bit of apparatus to a new use. Above all, the
practice teacher should be required to scout for living
material&mdash;there will usually be an abundance all about him, and
much that is of interest should find its way into the laboratory.
Training in the use of living material can not be over emphasized.</p>

<p>The course which I have outlined in the previous pages, is not
satisfactory, but I firmly believe that it would be an improvement
over the present situation. When tried out it would show many
shortcomings, but by trial and improvement has our entire educational
system evolved. Even an ideal professional course in use today would
be obsolete tomorrow. It would be unfortunate were it not so, for
growth involves ecdysis, and growth is the law of nature.</p>
